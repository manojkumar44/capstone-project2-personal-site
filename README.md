# capstone-project2-personal-site
The goal of this project was to create a personal website that showcased our skills, experiences, and interests. The website was to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, while also providing relevant information about ourselves. The site was built entirely with HTML and CSS, with no JavaScript code included.
